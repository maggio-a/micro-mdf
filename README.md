MircoMDF - A minimal Macro Data Flow framework
==============================================

This repository holds the source code of my project submission for the
Distributed Systems course final exam. It is a C++11 header only implementation
of a parallel Macro Data Flow interpreter. A presentation of the Macro Data
Flow execution model can be found [here](http://pages.di.unipi.it/danelutto/WP3homepage/SlidesKracow/DataFlow.pdf).
See the [project report](./report.pdf) for an overview of the implemented
features and some performance tests.
